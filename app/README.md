# TheMovieDatabaseApp
TheMovieDatabaseApp is an app which manages search results to show movies. This is my first app using the MVP pattern and it was nice! it really useful to maintain code.

##Funcionalidad
* When the app is launched, an infinitelist of the most popular movies is displayed.
* As soon as the user scrolls down and reaches the end of the list, the next page of movies is loaded.
* The user have the possibility to search for a movie by keyword and it is automatically executed while typing the search term. So, when the user continues typing, the old search is cancelled and a search for the new term is started and scrollable via pagination. 

##Libraries
* Picaso to manage images
* OkHttp to consume The Database Movie API REST
* ButterKnife to bind views

If something is wrong, feel free to add an improvement. Thank you!
